# Sorting Algorithms

## selection_sort

 Sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

## merge_sort

Write a function that accepts an array of unsorted integers, and returns a sorted array by a recursive mergesort algorithm.

## quick_sort

chooses a pivot, then places all values lower than the pivot value before the pivot index, and all values greater than the pivot after the pivot. This is done recursively for all sub-sets of the array to ensure the full array is sorted in acsending order.
