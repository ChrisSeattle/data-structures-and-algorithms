# Sorting Algorithms

##selection_sort

 Sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

##quick_sort

chooses a pivot, then places all values lower than the pivot value before the pivot index, and all values greater than the pivot after the pivot. This is done recursively for all sub-sets of the array to ensure the full array is sorted in acsending order.
